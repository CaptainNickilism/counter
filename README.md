# Counter
This is a simple counter made as a project for [Start2Impact](https://www.start2impact.it/) with HTML, CSS and JavaScript which lets the user either increase or decrease the number shown by clicking on the respective button.

## Installation
- Download the project files
- Open "index.html" in a browser
- Enjoy :)

You can also use the counter without downloading the files: you can find an online working version at [my personal website](http://nickilism.42web.io/projects/counter/index.html)

## Usage
You can adjust the counter value by clicking either the DECREASE BUTTON ("-"), which will subtract 1, or the INCREASE BUTTON ("+"), which will add 1.

## Support

## Author
The counter was made by me, Niccolò Pagnacco.
